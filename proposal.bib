  Abstract                 = {Radiation damage is traditionally modelled using cascade simulations, and the effect of inelastic scattering by electrons, if included, is introduced via a friction term in the equation of motion. We have developed a model in which the molecular dynamics simulation is coupled to a model for the electronic energy, which evolves via the heat diffusion equation. Energy lost by the atoms, due electronic stopping or electron–ion interactions, is input to the electronic system via a source term in the diffusion equation. Energy is fed back to the atomic system from the hot electrons by means of a Langevin thermostat, which depends on the local electronic temperature. Results of the model are presented for 10 keV cascades in Fe.},

The acronym ESPRESSO stands for opEn Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization . It is freely available to researchers around the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.},

  Abstract                 = {The swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation of materials is often modelled using the two-temperature model. While the model has been successful in describing SHI damage in metals, it fails to account for the presence of a bandgap in semiconductors and insulators. Here we explore the potential to overcome this limitation by explicitly incorporating the influence of the bandgap in the parameterisation of the electronic specific heat for Si. The specific heat as a function of electronic temperature is calculated using finite temperature density functional theory with three different exchange correlation functionals, each with a characteristic bandgap. These electronic temperature dependent specific heats are employed with two-temperature molecular dynamics to model ion track creation in Si. The results obtained using a specific heat derived from density functional theory showed dramatically reduced defect creation compared to models that used the free electron gas specific heat. As a consequence, the track radii are smaller and in much better agreement with experimental observations. We also observe a correlation between the width of the band gap and the track radius, arising due to the variation in the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat.},

At high fluences, in excess of approximately 5 × 1012 ions/cm2, where the surface is completely covered by ion tracks, synchrotron small angle x-ray scattering measurements reveal the existence of a steady state of density fluctuations. In agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, this steady state is consistent with an ion track 'annihilation' process, where high-density regions generated in the periphery of new tracks fill in low-density regions located at the center of existing tracks.

  Abstract                 = {A common misconception is that the irradiation of solids with energetic electrons and ions has exclusively detrimental effects on the properties of target materials. In addition to the well-known cases of doping of bulk semiconductors and ion beam nitriding of steels, recent experiments show that irradiation can also have beneficial effects on nanostructured systems. Electron or ion beams may serve as tools to synthesize nanoclusters and nanowires, change their morphology in a controllable manner, and tailor their mechanical, electronic, and even magnetic properties. Harnessing irradiation as a tool for modifying material properties at the nanoscale requires having the full microscopic picture of defect production and annealing in nanotargets. In this article, we review recent progress in the understanding of effects of irradiation on various zero-dimensional and one-dimensional nanoscale systems, such as semiconductor and metal nanoclusters and nanowires, nanotubes, and fullerenes.

The 2T-MD model provides an explanation of the origin of the track radii saturation at high electronic stopping power.

  Abstract                 = {Classical cascade simulations of radiation damage generally neglect the effect of energy exchange between the lattice and the electrons; however electronic effects increase with increasing radiation energy. Indeed, even for low energy radiation events the electrons contribute to heat transport and increase the cooling rate, particularly in materials with strong electron–ion interactions. We use a method described in an earlier publication to include these effects in a series of 10 keV cascades in Fe, for a range of electron–ion interaction strengths. We find a non-monotonic relationship between the number of residual defects and the strength of the electron–ion interactions and we discuss the mechanisms involved.},

  Abstract                 = {A new approach to the reverse Monte Carlo analysis of total scattering data from polycrystalline materials is presented. The essential new feature is the incorporation of an explicit analysis of the Bragg peaks using a profile refinement, taking account of the instrument resolution function. Other new features including fitting data from magnetic materials, modelling lattice site disorder and new restraint and constraint options. The new method is demonstrated by a brief review of studies carried out during its development. The new program RMCProfile represents a significant advance in the analysis of polycrystalline total scattering data, especially where the local structure is to be explored within the true constraints of the long-range average structure.},
