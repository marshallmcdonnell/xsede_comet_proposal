The main engine for the MD simulations will be the Large-Scale Atomistic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) software \cite{Plimpton1995, LAMMPSwebsite}. This code has been shown to be highly-scalable for a variety of machine architectures: IBM BG/L, Cray XT3, Cray XT5, and Intel clusters with GPUs (Comet) \cite{LAMMPSbench}. For the MD simulations, LAMMPS is used due to its extremely parallel platform, large and active developer base, and large range of features and MD techniques. This last point is a main reason we will LAMMPS over other codes that have shown better performance using GPUs (i.e. HOOMD-Blue \cite{Anderson2008, Glaser2015}). Specifically, the electronic-phonon coupling capabilities are already present in LAMMPS that will be used for the cascade simulations.
