The main engine for the MD simulations will be the Large-Scale Atomistic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) software. This code is highly-scalable for a variety of machine architectures: IBM BG/L, Cray XT3, Cray XT5, and Intel clusters with GPUs (Comet). It can take advantage of GPU and Intel MIC accelerators with good performance scaling. For documentation on general benchmarking of LAMMPS, the following website contains several benchmark problems for a variety of machines: \href{http://lammps.sandia.gov/bench.html}{http://lammps.sandia.gov/bench.html}.
