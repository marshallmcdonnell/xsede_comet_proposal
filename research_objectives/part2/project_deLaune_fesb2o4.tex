\subsubsection*{Project 3: Modeling oxygen insertion in one-dimensional channels of shafarzikite-like structures}\label{deLaune}
Support work in understanding the atomic-level structural changes in shafarzikite-like (FeSb2O4) structures. Will look specifically at the oxygen insertion into cobalt and lead doped derivatives of shafarzikite. These materials show promise in applications of electro-catalysis due to their unique 1-D cation channels with high peroxide anion mobility and potential for high, directed electronic conductivity. Will help with correction and analysis of the neutron scattering data to push modeling efforts to clarify the oxidized structures.
